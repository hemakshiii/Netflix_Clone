# Netflix Clone using React.js
Developed a Netflix clone frontend application using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.js leveraging the Netflix API to dynamically fetch movie and TV show data. The project focused on delivering a user-friendly browsing experience akin to the original Netflix platform, featuring responsive design elements for compatibility across devices.
This endeavor not only honed my frontend development skills but also showcased my ability to integrate external APIs to create dynamic and interactive web applications, contributing to a comprehensive portfolio of projects that highlight my proficiency in frontend development.
